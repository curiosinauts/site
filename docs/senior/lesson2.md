# Lesson 2

Why repeat manually when you can for loop
```
for i in range(30):
    print("I will never win an enemy")
```

Variable substitution
```
sentence_mon  = "I will never win an enemy"
sentence_tues = "I will be nice"
```

Take an input instead of `hard code`
```
sentence_mon  = "I will never win an enemy"
sentence_tues = "I will be nice"

repeat = input("how many times : ")

for i in range(int(repeat)):
    print(sentence_mon)
```

Printing $ 5 times
```
print("$" * 5)
```
