# Lesson 5

# REPL again and Modulo operator

``` bash
# Practice using REPL
>>> a = 2

>>> b = 8

>>> a + b
10

>>> c = 1 / 2

>>> 1 / 2
0.5

# modulo operator
>>> 1 % 2
1

>>> 2 % 2
0

>>> c = 2 % 2
>>> c
0

# if statement
>>> c == 0
True

# Pseudo code
# if True:
#     do something
```

## even or odd number

Pseudo code
``` py
# We iterate through 1 through 10

# Check to see if current iteration value of i is even

# Print value of i

# Print "even" if the current value of i is even
```

=== "expected output 1"

## Make it pretty

Pseudo code

# Modify the code from above and make the output look easier to read

# You may utilize f string from lesson 1

# You may utilize 'end' argument in lesson 4
