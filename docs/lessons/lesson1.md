# Lesson 1

When you open a terminal and type `python` you are getting into REPL mode.
```
> python
1 + 1
2
```

REPL mode allows you to test out simple python code. It can come in handy.

I encourage to have fun by writing code to break your computer. Learning to code is all about making silly mistakes. If you make enough silly mistakes then you end up with awesome code.
